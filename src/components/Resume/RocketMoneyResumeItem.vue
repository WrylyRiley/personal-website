        Once a unicorn, now a part of something bigger. I'm working on a
        full-stack
        <span class="pill react-blue">React Native</span> personal finance
        management app, and the associated web UI with
        <span class="pill react-blue">React</span>. About a quarter of my time
        is focused on marketing and analytics engineering, and the rest is
        working cross-team with product, infrastructure, internal tooling,
        architecture, feature development, and more!
