        small team. BIG DREAMS. We were a tiny team using
        <span class="pill angular-red">Angular 8</span> with
        <span class="pill arango-green">ArangoDB</span> to visualize client
        workflows. Our goal was to have out clients be able to analyze all of
        their products and services, and then funnel them into using our
        consulting services for optimization.
